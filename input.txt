The big bat was by the bog.
Bob and Ben saw the bus.
The bun was baked by the best.
Bit by bit, the box broke.
A bad bug bit the boy.
The bay was bright blue.
Ben got a bag of bread.
The bee buzzed near the bud.
Bat and ball are in the bin.
Boys play by the big bin.
Bobby sees a big box.
The bib was blue and bright.
Bob has a bit of cake.
A bur was caught on the bus.
The bow was made of blue.
Bees buzz by the blossom.
Bub loves his big toy.
The bus was back by noon.
Ben has a big bag of buds.
The bog was wet and boggy.
